Project Overview: As health is one of the most important assets that humans possess, it is the foundation for a good quality of life, longevity, and mental well-being. Therefore, there is a pressing need for accessible, accurate and user-friendly tools that empower people to make informed decisions about their well-being. That’s why we propose to create a health screening application that leverages state of the art AI model for disease screening based on user symptoms. 

Problem we are addressing and developed solution: 
As a new international student at the University of Detroit mercy, we firsthand understood how important health insurance is for people here to be able to access good health care. Due to this, we were curious about how accessible health care is for the people of Detroit. Where according to 2018 Survey conducted by the University of Michigan’s Detroit Metro Area Community Study, about 8.7% of Detroit residents don’t have Health insurance (University of Michigan's Detroit Metro Area Community Study, 2018).  While a big number of people in Detroit have health insurance, we see that many people still face barriers to accessing care, for example, 10% of Detroit residents say that they can’t afford to pay copayment or prescription costs (University of Michigan's Detroit Metro Area Community Study, 2018). These barriers to health care, are even more prevalent for young adults, immigrants, and low-income households. Considering all the barriers to health care that exist for people, we wanted to create an open-source symptom screening application that utilized AI to provide people awareness on their probable prognosis. By providing people with such insights, we hoped that people would make informed decisions, for example getting early diagnosis and treatment for certain health conditions, before it’s too late. This application in no way can replace the care provided by a doctor and only aims to provide insights to users based on their symptoms.

Project Description:
1.	AI Disease prediction model:
We will leverage a pre-built AI model that claims to predict diseases with 90% or higher accuracy. While no model is truly perfect, we intend to use this model as a foundation for our application. Our team will meticulously evaluate its performance and potentially fine-tune it further to ensure the best possible results.

2.	Feature engineering and Cross validation:
One of our key objectives is to reduce the number of questions users need to answer to obtain insightful disease predictions. The original model asks users 132 questions, and we feel this is a lot, where it might even prevent certain users from utilizing this service. Therefore, we will employ advanced feature engineering techniques to identify and prioritize the most relevant symptoms, optimizing the user experience while maintaining high prediction accuracy of the provided prognosis.

3.	Interactive Website:
We aim to create an engaging and user-friendly web platform where users can enter their symptoms and receive predictions about potential diseases. The website will be designed with an emphasis on intuitive navigation, and a pleasant user experience. It will be accessible via various devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.

4.	Providing brief insights on prognosis:
Once our model provides prognosis to users, they can check on our website to get brief insights on their prognosis. As this model is under Apache 2.0 open-source license, and most tools used to implement this application are open source, we aim to create a skeleton framework, with the hope that it will be community driven and continue to add new feature for users to make users more informed, for example providing information on prescription medication and their possible side effects. To add validity to this platform, we would like to cooperate with medical professionals in the future.
